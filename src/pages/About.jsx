      <p>
        BECOMING a full-stack web developer is directly related to my obsession
        with marrying music and technology, along with the rabbit hole that is
        my startup-ConcertMagnet. My love for music and its industry started at
        quite a young age. I've been blessed enough to work intermittently in
        music, with managers who've handled some of the most revered artists in
        the world, and at Electric Lady Studios, where some of the greatest
        producers historically recorded some of the greatest music. Being a
        creative and a founder has set me on a path where I wear many hats. It's
        unearthed that I am a natural advisor and business strategist, who
        resides "outside the box" in my thinking. I have an eye for design, a
        passion for writing compelling copy, and a knack for edgy marketing.
        Aside from steadily moving towards my goal of SCRUM Master, my focus is
        music business development that not only creates a more prosperous,
        monetized industry, but also hand-in-hand, funds causes that create
        harmony between man, animals, and the environment.
